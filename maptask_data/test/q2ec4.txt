f|not quite|reply_n
g|right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right|ready align
f|was i|query_w
g|yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint|reply_y clarify instruct
f|right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so|acknowledge explain query_w

f|mm aye directly above the noose that's a better description|reply_y
g|okay from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit|acknowledge instruct
f|on its right-hand side|check
