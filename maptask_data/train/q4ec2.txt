f|don't think i've got that on mine|explain
g|ah right|acknowledge

g|ehm no|reply_n
f|well i've got overgrown gully|explain
g|ah right overgrown gully there's no such thing eh on my map ehm the next one you've got to go to can you see springboks on yours|acknowledge explain query_yn
f|no where's that in relation to highest viewpoint|reply_n query_w
g|it's right next to it virtually|reply_w
f|to its right or left|query_w
g|to its left|reply_w
f|on the same level as highest viewpoint yeah|check
g|just slightly below it|reply_w
f|okay right|acknowledge
g|right go along to your right eh from where you last drew eh in a straight line horizontally|ready instruct
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|and then go up between the the two words springboks and highest viewpoint|instruct
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|and then ehm once you then go round the top eh go to your right eh horizontally go where are you at the moment are you just at springboks here|instruct align
f|well where i think that is and the highest viewpoint's above where i am just now|reply_y explain
g|right okay right go vertically up then between the the springboks and highest viewpoint|acknowledge instruct
f|okay am i meant to be trying to go under highest viewpoint like under|check
g|no no you're meant to be going between eh springboks and highest viewpoint|reply_n clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|and once you get to above highest viewpoint eh you go horizontally|instruct
f|above highest viewpoint|check
g|yes above highest|reply_y clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|right then go eh uh to your right horizontally then eh come once you're once you've eh passed highest viewpoint eh and there's nothing below you eh apart from safari truck if you can see that there|instruct instruct align
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|right go vertically down to just above eh safari truck|instruct
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|right now what you want to do is diagonally eh from eh right to left go eh in front of safari truck|instruct
f|like coming underneath it|check
g|ehm you go up safari no no i don't mean go underneath it go like over it as it were|reply_n clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|eh right so you're actually going from going diagonally eh from right to left above safari truck|clarify
f|oh okay|acknowledge
g|right|align
f|to where|query_w
g|to just ehm below the level of field station|reply_w
f|not got that have you got banana tree|explain query_yn
g|aye the banana tree is there a field station there as well|reply_y query_yn
f|no nothing there oh yeah yes uh-huh|reply_n reply_y
g|yeah right|acknowledge
f|so i'm going towards field station|check
g|yeah go towards field station right|reply_y instruct
f|okay|acknowledge
g|until you're eh just underneath the level of the words field station|instruct
f|okay|acknowledge
g|these are identical maps i hope right eh right then you want to go horizontally eh from eh right to left eh above the banana tree above eh the actual banana tree itself|explain ready instruct
f|i just double back the way|check
g|yes like that|reply_y clarify
f|okay where to|acknowledge query_w
g|right just until you're past banana tree|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|then come vertically down until you come to gold mine|instruct
f|don't have a gold mine|explain
g|you don't have a gold mine|check
f|no|reply_n
g|you must have a gold mine somewhere yeah|explain
f|i don't i didn't have that|explain
g|is it is it below banana tree|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|no|acknowledge
f|rock fall i've got|explain
g|rock fall surely between rock fall and banana tree you've got a gold mine no|acknowledge align
f|no|reply_n
g|is it is it anywhere at all near|query_yn
f|i've got to the right of banana tree and down there's rope bridge|reply_w
g|eh say that again to the|check
f|to the right of banana tree there's a rope bridge|clarify
g|right now that's slightly down isn't it|acknowledge query_yn
f|yeah uh-huh|reply_y
g|and eh rock fall is like eh it forms a triangle|query_yn
f|yeah that's right aye|reply_y
g|right|acknowledge
f|where's your gold mine|query_w
g|well my gold mine is uh the eh the mid point of the banana tree and rock fall line|reply_w
f|right well no i haven't got that|acknowledge explain
g|so you don't have that ehm right well mine that must mean that this that you can bypass this obstacle so ehm from where you are you're you're you're next to banana tree the word aren't you yeah is that where you are|acknowledge explain align
f|i'm above banana tree|reply_w
g|you're certainly above it right|acknowledge
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree|instruct
f|okay|acknowledge
g|now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down|instruct explain instruct
f|from banana tree over to rope bridge|check
g|yeah well no no no just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge|reply_y reply_n reply_n clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|it's just slightly below that ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there|instruct instruct
f|sorry say that again|check
g|right|ready
f|right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now|explain
g|you're beside rope bridge|check
f|did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to|check
g|yes i meant to go straight down yeah|reply_y clarify
f|right okay i'll just change that|acknowledge explain
g|right|acknowledge
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|right so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly|ready align instruct
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge|acknowledge instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself|instruct
f|mmhmm and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page|acknowledge check
g|it's more or less yes in the centre of the page|reply_y
f|roughly okay|acknowledge
g|right then|ready instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|right from there you want to eh go from left to right across the rope bridge and it's actually ehm if if you think of a it was it's not on the rope bridge the word but the rope bridge itself you want the the the line to pass through the diagram|instruct
f|uh-huh right|acknowledge
g|right|align
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly|ready query_yn
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|right ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes|acknowledge instruct

f|no that that won't that won't affect it|explain
g|right okay so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page|ready instruct
f|from before crossing the rope bridge|check
g|well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right|clarify

g|oh right so they're so they're actually barring that way|acknowledge check
f|without the crocodiles well i imagine so less i just drew round them which i suppose i could|explain reply_y explain
g|eh can you actually draw round them|query_yn
