f|half a centimetre under the carpenter's house right|acknowledge
g|so|ready
f|so we're down below the carpenter's house about half a centimetre|check
g|on the level yeah but across below the start see what i mean|instruct reply_y clarify align
f|oh away round here below the start|check
g|yeah so it's that's the level you're going to|reply_y clarify
f|ah right so it sort of curves round like that backwards c as you've said|acknowledge check
g|it's not it's just to the it's to the left of the haystack it's just a really shallow thing|reply_n clarify
f|doesn't sound like what i've got|explain
g|right you right we'll start again then you've got the start line right|ready clarify ready instruct align
f|this is a good one|explain

f|and you you come to the the roof a point where the roof of the carpenter's house left-hand side an inch above it|check check
g|well right from the start you're starting directly below the start point is where you want to go that well make that the first move you got that you got that it's shallow curve|ready ready instruct align
f|right shallow curve i've got i go down just and curve round the haystack|ready reply_y check
g|well not round you want to finish below the starting point you go down you curve past you curve past the haystack|reply_n clarify
f|so just a wee|check
g|it's like a an inverted c|clarify
f|so i'm curving back like|check
g|it's like a c the wrong way round|clarify
f|well i'm just curving back in|check
g|yeah you're coming round to to below the start point which is also on a level below the carpenter's house that's to tell you where to stop|reply_y clarify
f|all right so i'm actually i'm starting here and i'm finishing|acknowledge check
g|directly below start|clarify
f|so it's just a wee shallow curve|check
g|aye|reply_y
f|well i'll have to miss the blacksmith i've got a blacksmith's right okay that's|explain
g|that's you okay so you should just be about half a centimetre below the carpenter's house right|acknowledge align
f|a lot of rubbing scribbling going on here|explain
g|so you're half a centimetre below the carpenter's house you're on that level|align
f|right mmhmm right okay|reply_y reply_y reply_y

f|yeah a wee bit further|reply_y explain
g|now you've got that point in then yes|ready align
f|yeah|reply_y
g|so you want to go up you see the carpenter's house the roof the left-hand point of the roof|instruct align
f|mmhmm so i want to go up to|reply_y check
g|so you want to go up there's an inch above there right just maybe a bit less than an inch right|reply_y instruct align
f|right so|reply_y
g|and you want to join that point those two points up and that's in a sort of thirty thirty degree angle or something like that|instruct

f|no i'm not an inch above them to the the carpenter's house an inch above the top left corner is is on a level with that the top of the seven beeches so now i've gone down|reply_n explain
g|not an inch above them well you want to be about call it half an inch above the seven beeches|acknowledge instruct
f|right so i'll just|acknowledge
g|right|align
f|right okay|reply_y
g|and from that point there you want to go about it's just off south to below the s in seven beeches|instruct
f|just off south|acknowledge
g|it's southeast you want to be going right just below the s|align
f|southeast mmhmm right down that way just below the s wait a minute|reply_y explain
g|right|align
f|just below the s|acknowledge
g|now eh you've got reclaimed fields down below that|ready query_yn
f|yeah i have|reply_y
g|down below well in between the seven beeches and the reclaimed fields i've got a chapel okay|acknowledge ready explain align
f|mm right i don't have that|reply_y explain
g|so eh what i need to do is i need to go round it again an inverted c well it's no an inverted c it's the other way about opposite c|ready instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and you need to go around it so eh|instruct
f|so i sort of curve underneath seven beeches and round and then over to back to where i started from|check
g|yeah so you the the actual point where you want to finish up is eh you see the the thick tree trunk on the right-hand side of the seven beeches|reply_y instruct align
f|mmhmm the the the furthest right one|reply_y check
g|so you want to finish yeah you want to finish about two inches below that|instruct reply_y instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|which is about about a centimetre above the reclaimed fields does that make sense to you|instruct align
f|no the reclaimed fields are quite a distance away|reply_n explain
g|miles below it yeah|check
f|aye|reply_y
g|well eh we'll call it just about two inches maybe a bit more call it two and a half inches below the tree trunk right|ready instruct align
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|and that's where you want to finish up|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|so to do that you'll need to take from the s and go round like from twelve o'clock to three o'clock|instruct
f|yeah around|acknowledge

f|and then and then back in again|explain explain
g|from the s and then back into that point i told you|instruct instruct
f|yeah|acknowledge
g|right|align
f|got that|reply_y
g|now you want to go like the end of a test tube like that way you want to go round the reclaimed fields like that have you got crane bay|ready instruct query_yn
f|crane bay yeah|reply_y
g|you see the the most northerly tip above the b|align
f|over the right yeah|reply_y
g|well you want to come round the test round the reclaimed fields and the test tube sort of shape to about oh i don't know about an inch and a half above the b|ready instruct
f|an inch above the b|acknowledge check
g|above the b yeah well|reply_y ready
f|so the point right|acknowledge
g|no above the point sorry above the tip|reply_n reply_w reply_w
f|have you got whitewashed cottage|query_yn
g|no|reply_n
f|no so i'll have to miss that so if i come round in my curve and then i'm going along and then curving back round the same way|acknowledge explain ready check
g|yeah so the shape will be you'll be going east and then you'll be going down|reply_y clarify
f|a kind of inverted in a s a backwards s|check
g|it's not well|reply_n clarify
f|sort of|ready
g|it's just like that shape you want to do so you're going east and then you're going that curve and then you're going west until you're above that tip|clarify clarify
f|ah well the whole thing in together like from the seven beeches round it's like an c and then and it's like a normal c sort of right i'll try and an inch and a half above there i'll have to draw it a bit squint so i'm so i'm coming down on the right-hand the left-hand side of the reclaimed fields|ready explain explain check
g|yeah|reply_y
f|and i've sort of curved round to about there|check
g|so you've got you've gone round the reclaimed fields|check
f|mmhmm|reply_y
g|and you're about an inch and a half above the tip the northern-most tip|check
f|yeah about an inch|reply_y

f|so skirting skirting along|check
g|yeah no eh|align reply_n
f|just straight line|check
g|just a you want to do a centimetre above the western-most tip right and draw a straight line from where you've stopped now you know when|clarify align
f|uh-huh so it's right so it's just like a straight line from the south that bit there where it goes due south to about a centimetre above|reply_y check
g|that's right|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|so it's about that sort of angle|clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|now you want to go due west until you're above the a in attractive cliffs|ready instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and then take it down about about the same angle as you took from the south to the west tip take that down to the bottom just on the same level as attractive cliffs so you're doing down that angle and it's about an inch long shall we say|instruct instruct
f|right right|acknowledge acknowledge

f|mmhmm so i've taken my i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point|acknowledge check
g|about half an inch|clarify
f|above|check
g|no you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree|reply_n clarify
f|yeah|acknowledge
g|and you then you go due north|clarify
f|oh right i've go to the i go to the base of the tree|acknowledge check
g|from there you half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk|clarify
f|curve around|check
g|all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the|clarify
f|right right and that's it there|acknowledge acknowledge check
g|and that's your finish so your the finish point should be level with where the branches start|clarify clarify
f|uh-huh right|acknowledge
