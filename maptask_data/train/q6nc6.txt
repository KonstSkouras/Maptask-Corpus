f|right|acknowledge
g|i see so you've got to basically from where you are go along very slightly and then curve up over the swan pond and then back down to the same level that you're at so the curve you want to get is basically to the top of the saloon bar is the level curve up there and then curve down ehm about well see you're|instruct
f|how long is this swan|query_w
g|right the end of it is at directly down from the end of the stone slabs|ready reply_w
f|right so i've got that and then i go down to where i was|acknowledge check
