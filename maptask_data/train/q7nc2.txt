f|oh|acknowledge
g|you're making me pick my nose|explain
f|well we we might be in the chestnut trees might be in different position is it a bloop like a kind of round bit|explain check
g|yeah just|reply_y
f|like what we did round the fields|query_yn
g|sort of but very very|clarify
f|earlier on|query_yn

g|so how how|query_w
f|where do and i'm just above the spaceship right|align
g|okay so|reply_y
f|so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got|query_yn
g|is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree|query_yn
f|no it's just above the tree|reply_n reply_w
g|oh no you should be|reply_n
f|it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree|explain
g|okay well just just go to the right about an inch and then draw an "x" and we'll be done|acknowledge ready instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|i got to see your map|explain
