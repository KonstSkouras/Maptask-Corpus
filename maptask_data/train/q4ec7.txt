g|start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map|instruct explain
f|oh|acknowledge
g|but it's marked well|explain
f|okay i was looking at the top|acknowledge explain
g|have you found it|align
f|yeah it's okay|reply_y
g|right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|and stop|instruct
f|is that horizontally|check
g|horizontally yeah sorry|reply_y
f|okay|acknowledge
g|and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it|instruct
f|pen's not working there that's done it okay|explain
g|and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement|instruct instruct query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map|explain
f|mm|acknowledge
g|it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped|explain instruct
f|okay mmhmm|acknowledge acknowledge
g|along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge|instruct
f|just in a horizontal line|check
g|horizontal line straight across|reply_y
f|okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement|check
g|well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it|reply_w
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement|reply_w
f|okay how far away from the edge of the paper|acknowledge query_w
g|one and a half centimetres|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|stop|instruct
f|just get my ruler out|explain
g|have you got a rope bridge|query_yn
f|yeah|reply_y
g|if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean|instruct align
f|mmhmm|reply_y
g|so|ready
f|okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper|ready check
g|upwards for about|clarify
f|the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge|check
g|yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round|reply_y reply_n clarify
f|below the writing of rope bridge|check
g|no|reply_n
f|below|acknowledge
g|below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge|clarify clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge|clarify
f|okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah|acknowledge check
g|yes you|reply_y
f|okay|acknowledge
g|are you crossing the rope bridge|align
f|you want me to cross it uh-huh|check
g|well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|and then stop when you get to the other side|instruct
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|so|ready
f|do you have a machete|query_yn
g|no i don't where's the machete|reply_n query_w
f|it's to the right and just down|reply_w
g|from the rope bridge|query_yn
f|it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay|reply_w query_yn
g|is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down|query_yn explain
f|mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map|acknowledge query_w
g|you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position|reply_w
f|okay that's fine i'll just go underneath it then|acknowledge explain
g|and stop when you're you're have you got a collapsed shelter|instruct query_yn
f|uh-huh just above there|reply_y query_yn
g|yeah|reply_y
f|so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh|check
g|about two underneath it|reply_w
f|that's fine|acknowledge
g|have you got a saxon barn|query_yn
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|well you go straight up from that point where you were|instruct
f|mm|acknowledge
g|past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn|instruct instruct
f|mmhmm so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left|acknowledge check
g|and stop there no straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map|instruct reply_n clarify
f|so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the|check
g|no straight line upwards|reply_n clarify
f|well i can't do that|explain
g|why not|query_w
f|'cause my saxon barn's on the|reply_w
g|no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter|clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it|clarify
f|oh okay have you got a crevasse|acknowledge query_yn
g|no|reply_n
f|well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn|query_w
g|no so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn|reply_n query_yn
f|if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up would that be okay|reply_w query_yn
g|if you go well i was going|reply_w
f|so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah|check
g|but the the top of it|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|just a bit above and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon barn|clarify instruct
f|say that again i'm on just now i'm on a horizontal line just beside above the saxon barn|query_w explain
g|but not right over it|check
f|no i'm not beside it yet|reply_n explain
g|no right ehm so you would ehm is where's the crevasse from there is it underneath you|acknowledge clarify query_yn
f|it's just beside me just now it's just to my right like if i if i went sorry if i went to my left i would pass the crevasse and i would pass the saxon barn|reply_w
g|right so if you go over the top of the crevasse and down the side of it then underneath the saxon barn could you do that|acknowledge clarify query_yn
f|you want me to draw underneath the saxon barn|check
g|yes|reply_y

g|so you're at the top of the white mountain just now|align
f|mmhmm|reply_y
g|go straight up five or six centimetres and stop|instruct
f|right i'm meant to be right on top of white mountain just well just beside the top yeah|check
g|well yes parallel to it uh-huh|reply_y
f|so okay|acknowledge
g|straight up stop have you got slate mountain|clarify instruct query_yn
f|yeah|reply_y

g|and you got a secret valley|query_yn
f|yeah|reply_y
g|can you go down from there down the left-hand side of the secret valley|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|and are you underneath the secret valley|align
f|hold on you want me to be underneath the secret valley|check
g|go draw a straight line to the end of just about a centimetre away from the y and that's the finish|clarify
f|underneath it|check
g|underneath the y of secret valley|clarify
f|a centimetre down from the y yeah|check
g|mmhmm|reply_y
