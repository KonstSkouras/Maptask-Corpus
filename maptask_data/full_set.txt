g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|what bit of east lake do i go up to|query_w
g|just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve|clarify
f|i can imagine see where the see where the|acknowledge align
g|nuclear test site is|check
f|the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom right if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you know|align explain
g|to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lake|check
f|i can't yeah at the bottom i can't go any further left sorry further right than that because i've been i i'd need to go through the golf course so i've actually you know that's where i am now more or less beneath that point because that's the like the|explain reply_y explain explain

g|yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake|reply_y explain
f|mmhmm right okay|acknowledge
g|so if you went have you went round curved round the monument|align
f|yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now|reply_y explain
g|are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake|align
f|i've not done that yet|reply_n
g|see where east lake is|align
f|you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round|explain reply_y explain align check
g|are you talking about the very bottom|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|you talking about the bottom right|query_yn
f|the bottom left|explain
g|you've just reached there|check
f|yeah|reply_y
g|but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course|instruct query_yn
f|well i've already gone round it|ready explain
g|right|acknowledge
f|in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it|explain check
g|no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake|reply_n explain align
f|that's the finish|check
g|that's finish point|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left|ready explain
f|right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site|acknowledge check
g|right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then|explain explain instruct
f|between the golf course and the nuclear test site|check
g|it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument|check
f|yeah yeah mmhmm|reply_y reply_y
g|so have you gone round it as in have you gone round it on the right-hand side|query_yn
f|the left-hand side so i've i've to go round it on the right-hand side|explain check
g|uh-huh you've you come to the monument and you go round it the golf course trace|reply_y instruct
f|i so i've just i've just to pass the left-hand side of the nuclear test site|check
g|mmhmm mmhmm|reply_y
f|right okay no|reply_n
g|have you got a nuclear test site|check
f|but you told me it was just below east lake|check
g|it is but it's on the right-hand side on the right-hand but exactly under the right-hand side of east lake|reply_y explain
f|yes okay i'm just going up to the right-hand side of the golf course okay now|acknowledge explain
g|so you must like have to trace round it then|instruct
f|yeah okay|acknowledge
g|i take it on the right-hand side so it's between it|instruct
f|so that's me on the right-hand side of east lake now about a centimetre in from the from the right sorry|explain
g|eh|acknowledge
f|so i go left now i take it|check
g|so then you just just just just trace underneath the curve to the finish|instruct
f|right one centimetre to the left|acknowledge check
g|uh-huh yeah right that's the the finish point of east lake have you traced under the east lake|reply_y instruct align
f|that's the finish yeah so that's us finished|check reply_y check
g|i think so|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|right ehm eh the start is down at the bottom do you just have a plain bit of paper|ready explain query_yn

f|right could you just say that again|acknowledge query_w
g|right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden|clarify
f|right so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery|acknowledge check
g|no a curve going down the way uh|reply_n clarify
f|that's what i mean i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically|explain check
g|yes|reply_y
f|right and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden|acknowledge check
g|yeah you stop on a level with the disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden|reply_y clarify

f|mmhmm so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake so i curve round that|acknowledge explain check
g|yes|reply_y
f|right to the middle of the east lake|acknowledge check
g|to a line approximately just it's below the|clarify
f|yeah uh-huh|acknowledge
g|east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence|clarify
f|mm right done that|acknowledge acknowledge
g|right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side|instruct
f|mmhmm so sorry say that again|acknowledge query_w
g|on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence|clarify
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake|clarify
f|right actually touches the|acknowledge check
g|it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake|clarify
f|no right think that's where it is|acknowledge acknowledge explain
g|start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map|instruct explain
f|oh|acknowledge
g|but it's marked well|explain
f|okay i was looking at the top|acknowledge explain
g|have you found it|align
f|yeah it's okay|reply_y
g|right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left|instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|and stop|instruct
f|is that horizontally|check
g|horizontally yeah sorry|reply_y
f|okay|acknowledge
g|and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it|instruct
f|pen's not working there that's done it okay|explain
g|and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement|instruct instruct query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map|explain
f|mm|acknowledge
g|it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped|explain instruct
f|okay mmhmm|acknowledge acknowledge
g|along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge|instruct
f|just in a horizontal line|check
g|horizontal line straight across|reply_y
f|okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement|check
g|well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it|reply_w
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement|reply_w
f|okay how far away from the edge of the paper|acknowledge query_w
g|one and a half centimetres|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|stop|instruct
f|just get my ruler out|explain
g|have you got a rope bridge|query_yn
f|yeah|reply_y
g|if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean|instruct align
f|mmhmm|reply_y
g|so|ready
f|okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper|ready check
g|upwards for about|clarify
f|the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge|check
g|yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round|reply_y reply_n clarify
f|below the writing of rope bridge|check
g|no|reply_n
f|below|acknowledge
g|below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge|clarify clarify
f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge|clarify
f|okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah|acknowledge check
g|yes you|reply_y
f|okay|acknowledge
g|are you crossing the rope bridge|align
f|you want me to cross it uh-huh|check
g|well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge

f|it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay|reply_w query_yn
g|is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down|query_yn explain
f|mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map|acknowledge query_w
g|you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position|reply_w
