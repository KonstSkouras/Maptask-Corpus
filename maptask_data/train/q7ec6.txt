f|is that from the point with the seagulls|check
g|no the point from|reply_n clarify
f|halfway down so it's going to go up the way|check check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|it's an upwards curve or a downwards curve|check query_yn
g|what do you mean|query_w

g|down|reply_w
f|the curve down|acknowledge
g|down|clarify
f|just a shallow curve|check
g|uh-huh to where i told you the to two inches to the|reply_y clarify

f|no i'd need to go to about an inch have you got anything west|reply_n clarify query_yn
g|there's nothing on my map there how far right to go up on the east side of the banana trees|reply_n query_w ready align
f|yeah that's|reply_y
g|how far out would you have to be|query_w
f|well just about half an inch of where i am the now to the west then i'd need to go up and i've got a footbridge directly above that|ready reply_w explain
g|how is the banana tree area really big it's a|query_yn
f|yeah it's a huge big banana tree it's about one and a half times the size of crest falls|reply_y clarify
g|and it stretches from the below the footbridge|check
f|stretches yeah it's about an inch below the footbridge to about an inch fae the edge of the page fae the bottom of the page then about an inch in and it's about an inch and a half across|reply_w reply_y clarify
g|an inch in from where|query_w
f|an inch in from the left-hand side of the page|reply_w
g|and what do you mean an inch and a half across|query_w
f|well that's how wide it is the banana tree|clarify
g|that wide|check
f|aye it's about that wide|reply_y clarify
g|that wide or that wide|check
f|that wide where are we going to go anyway are we going try to get up the|clarify query_w

f|oh i can do that|explain
g|that's what i told you to go over three inches|clarify
f|oh sorry|acknowledge
g|along the bottom right come along for three inches|clarify align instruct
f|right then go up level with footbridge|reply_y check
g|no now you'll be about|reply_n ready align
f|an inch fae the edge and an inch fae the bottom|reply_w
g|well should make it just more than an inch from the maybe about two inches from the edge|instruct
f|what|query_w
g|right|align
f|i can't do that it's the banana tree|explain
g|right okay you'll have to go round them then now go up to where go slightly curving|acknowledge instruct instruct instruct
f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|ehm until you're at the "f" not to the "f" but on a level with the "f"|instruct
f|how far west of it|query_w
g|and end up on the same sort of the same vertical|instruct
f|mmhmm as the tree trunk|acknowledge explain
g|axis as what tree trunk|instruct query_w
f|the banana tree trunk|reply_w
g|i don't have the banana tree|explain
f|oh you've no got that so it's a bit|acknowledge explain
g|right make it that you're about three inches above the point you are just now three inches due north|ready instruct
f|right|acknowledge

f|aye|acknowledge
g|you've went down|align
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|and then along|align

g|its gradient changes to slightly less steep|align
f|mm a wee bit mm a totty totty wee bit aye|reply_y acknowledge
g|uh-huh slightly uh-huh well go up follow the side of the mountain up to that point still staying about half a centimetre away to a centimetre|acknowledge acknowledge ready instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and then have you got anything above that point above white mountain|query_yn
f|i've got lemon grove that's about two inches above it|reply_y

g|so just draw|clarify
f|dead on the level of it uh-huh|check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|right got you|acknowledge acknowledge
g|now from there draw another curve until you're below the "r" of about a centimetre below the "r" of remote|ready instruct

f|uh-huh|acknowledge
g|and then go about an inch further than that on the same level and that's your finishing point|instruct
f|so that'll be just about below the pyramid the extreme right-hand edge|check
