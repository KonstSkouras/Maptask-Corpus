g|no it's southwest er about five ten degrees off south to the southwest to finish under the beech tree the the right-hand beech tree|reply_n clarify
f|going southwest|check
g|going southwest|reply_y
f|to finish under the second beech tree i would have to go southeast if i only moved over one inch to the east in the first movement because you said two inches|explain
g|well make it one and a half inch sorry one and a half inch east|clarify
f|what's one and a half|query_w
