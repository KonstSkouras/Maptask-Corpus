f|mmhmm|acknowledge
g|right ehm if you go down about three inches down uh-huh|align instruct
f|right|acknowledge

g|you go to the old mill there's no picket fence here eh|instruct reply_w
f|you don't have a picket i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it|check explain check
g|well no i go down and then i turn right no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park|ready reply_n clarify query_yn
f|yeah it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine|reply_y explain
g|mm and have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the you've not to pass that fence|acknowledge query_yn
f|well if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence|ready reply_w
g|so then right i see so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first|ready acknowledge check instruct
f|where's your actually go to it well|query_w check ready
g|mmhmm|reply_y
f|i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing|explain
g|hmm but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first|acknowledge check
f|where well i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fence eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it on the map beneath it on the map|query_w ready reply_w explain
g|right okay mmhmm|acknowledge acknowledge
f|you know so i can go down and then to the right and and you know another couple of inches and that's me below the mill wheel|ready explain
g|the old mill|acknowledge
f|is that okay|align

f|yeah that's in the middle of my map right in the middle of the page|reply_y explain
g|uh-huh so if mm so if you go to the old mill and then|acknowledge ready instruct
f|i'd if i need to go beneath the old mill right okay|check align

g|no you you're actually meant to over the mill|reply_n clarify
f|over the mill|check
g|uh-huh as in on the left-hand side of it you know what i mean like going up round it on the map|reply_y clarify
f|mmhmm well my caravan park is on the left-hand side of the mill|acknowledge ready explain
g|uh-huh so is this right|acknowledge query_yn ready
f|so i could|check
g|it's on the it's on the far left isn't it|align
f|yeah my caravan park's on the far left|reply_y
g|uh-huh|acknowledge

g|uh-huh that's fine so if you you're going to the old mill|acknowledge instruct
f|first of all|query_yn
g|mmhmm|reply_y
f|it's the very first place i go|check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|well i can just draw a line straight between the two then right|ready explain align
g|yeah but on my map it's not got that it's eh you're going in a sort of curve to the bottom of the map then round the old mill|explain clarify
f|round beneath the old mill|check
g|uh-huh no you don't actually go under the old mill you go like round it like see the side where the steps are|reply_y reply_n clarify ready align
f|yeah|reply_y
g|like that's how you go just just go round the top|ready clarify
f|you actually go round the side where the where the wheel is|check

f|i mean surely you could just go you know you could just go straight from the caravan park to the abandoned cottage could you not|ready query_yn
g|no well on the route on this map is you've to go down|reply_n explain
f|so right so i'd i'd have to draw a curve then from the down from the caravan park|ready check
g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|from the mill wheel and up to the abandoned cottage to the right like a tick shape it'd be the shape of a tick from the the|check
g|no the shape of a like an oval shape from the caravan park you start just above the caravans|reply_n clarify
f|right|acknowledge

f|i can imagine see where the see where the|acknowledge align
g|nuclear test site is|check

g|yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake|reply_y explain
f|mmhmm right okay|acknowledge
g|so if you went have you went round curved round the monument|align
f|yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now|reply_y explain
g|are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake|align
f|i've not done that yet|reply_n
g|see where east lake is|align
f|you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round|explain reply_y explain align check
g|are you talking about the very bottom|query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|you talking about the bottom right|query_yn
f|the bottom left|explain
g|you've just reached there|check
f|yeah|reply_y
g|but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course|instruct query_yn
f|well i've already gone round it|ready explain
g|right|acknowledge
f|in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it|explain check
g|no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake|reply_n explain align
f|that's the finish|check
g|that's finish point|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left|ready explain
f|right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site|acknowledge check
g|right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then|explain explain instruct
f|between the golf course and the nuclear test site|check
g|it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument|check
f|yeah yeah mmhmm|reply_y reply_y
g|so have you gone round it as in have you gone round it on the right-hand side|query_yn
f|the left-hand side so i've i've to go round it on the right-hand side|explain check
g|uh-huh you've you come to the monument and you go round it the golf course trace|reply_y instruct
f|i so i've just i've just to pass the left-hand side of the nuclear test site|check
g|mmhmm mmhmm|reply_y
f|right okay no|reply_n
