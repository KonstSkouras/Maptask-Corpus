g|right ehm the diamond mine the the diamond mine is like just eh to the the the right of you there|ready explain
f|right i've got the diamond mine i've got the start and the diamond mine|acknowledge explain
g|right now just go down beside the left-hand side of the diamond mine and eh just to below the words the first d there|acknowledge instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|then draw a line ehm a kind of go from there eh to just below the s of springboks|instruct
f|don't have springboks|explain
g|you don't have that's right ehm okay right in that case just draw a horizontal line to just below the eh to the the left of the h of highest viewpoint|acknowledge ready instruct
f|horizontal|check
g|yes horizontal right|reply_y
f|hold on right|acknowledge
g|now we're going to go round eh highest viewpoint okay so eh|instruct align instruct
f|a curve or|check
g|it well we can do it in a well just go eh vertically up to the h|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|then make a curve round to the eh like a semicircle right|instruct align
f|okay|acknowledge
g|eh is there anything below there|query_w
f|there's the overgrown gully|reply_w
g|right and eh what about safari truck|acknowledge query_yn
f|yes i've got that|reply_y
g|now where's the overgrown gully|query_w
f|it's between highest viewpoint and the safari truck|reply_w
g|eh what the midway between them|check
f|yes|reply_y
g|and eh to the left or right of highest viewpoint|query_w
f|it's beneath it it's to the right-hand side|reply_w reply_w
g|it's directly beneath it to the right-hand side of safari truck|check acknowledge
f|slightly to the right-hand side|clarify
g|right of this one right okay|acknowledge
f|right to the middle of highest viewpoint anyway|clarify
g|okay right so go on the outsides eh towards the paper edge ehm down to safari truck in a a slight curve|acknowledge instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and then eh draw a diagonal line ehm from there across the top of safari truck down to field station|instruct
f|that's on my map it's slightly above field station slightly above safari truck|explain
g|what is above that|query_w
f|above that's field station's on a level slightly above safari truck|reply_w
g|right well mine's eh on the same level ehm it what what is there anything else that's in eh that's causing it to be up like that|acknowledge explain query_w
f|well there's a banana tree directly below diamond mine|reply_w
g|right|acknowledge
f|it's slightly below safari truck slightly below the level of safari truck|reply_w
g|right okay well eh you're just next to the eh that what was the object you've just drawn past|acknowledge query_w
f|i've just drawn past the overgrown gully i'm now at the top right-hand corner of safari truck|reply_w explain
g|right ehm well draw eh a kind of diagonal line and then turn it|acknowledge instruct
f|up or down|query_w
g|eh from right to left eh downwards eh underneath field station|clarify instruct
f|right that's way over the the far left-hand side of the page on my map|explain
g|where is field station|query_w
f|field station's way over the far left|reply_w
g|it's the far uh well there's two field stations on my map|acknowledge explain
f|there's not one on mine|explain
g|right so you've only got one there|acknowledge check
f|yes|reply_y
g|and none there in the centre right ehm in that case you want to draw the diagonal line and then where is banana tree|acknowledge instruct query_w
f|banana tree is directly below diamond mine and it's slightly above the centre of the page|reply_w
g|right so eh well draw this diagonal line down and then change it to a curve at the top level of banana tree and curve it round banana tree ehm with the apex of the curve pointing to the top right-hand corner sorry left-hand corner|acknowledge instruct
f|right what was that again sorry|query_w
g|right|acknowledge
f|this pen's running out i think|explain
g|if you hold it eh vertically it'll come down|explain
f|it's gone ah right|explain acknowledge
g|is it okay now|check
f|yes|reply_y
g|right ehm right i'll just do the the bit at the safari truck right draw a diagonal line from where you were right|explain clarify align
f|right|reply_y
g|eh to the same just below the the level of the word safari truck and between banana tree and safari truck|clarify
f|okay okay|acknowledge acknowledge
g|which is slightly above eh banana tree|explain
f|right|acknowledge
g|right then draw a curve over banana tree ehm and curving round on it|acknowledge instruct
f|down the left-hand side|check
g|right and ehm now do you have gold mine between eh banana tree and rock fall at the bottom there|reply_y query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|right in that case eh well gold mine on my map is halfway between rock fall and banana tree|acknowledge explain
f|okay directly below|acknowledge check
g|okay it's directly below banana tree and directly above rock fall|align clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|and it's eh in the at the mid point of the two of that line|clarify
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right so ehm i want you to come down to two thirds of the way between eh rock fall and banana tree have|align instruct
f|is that two thirds beneath banana tree or two thirds up|check
g|two eh that's two third beneath banana tree|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|right ehm now there i want you to draw ehm a horizontal line to the left sorry to the right sorry eh to the right just eh so that you're on the other side of banana tree if you understand|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|then the rope bridge can you see that on your map|query_yn
f|yes that's slightly above it's between where i am and banana tree roughly about halfway between|reply_y explain
g|between where you are and where|query_w
f|banana tree|reply_w
g|right well|acknowledge
f|it's on a line roughly between that it's over to the right-hand side of the page|clarify
g|right ehm are crocodiles the other side of the thing|acknowledge query_yn
f|yes|reply_y
g|yeah ehm and eh the crocodile's to the right of the rope bridge|acknowledge query_yn
f|yes|reply_y
g|right|acknowledge
f|to the right and below|clarify
g|right and below right ehm what i want you to do is is there anything between the eh between the where you are now and the rope bridge|acknowledge instruct query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|right i want you to draw a line up to the rope bridge|acknowledge instruct
f|straight line|check
g|yes a straight line up to rope bridge so that you can cross the rope bridge the actual bridge drawing of the bridge right|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|now do you have giraffes at the bottom eh right-hand corner|query_yn
f|yes|reply_y
g|right i want you to eh draw round the crocodile eh on the outside of the page down to giraffes|acknowledge instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|right i want you to go underneath the giraffes and there's any other obstacles there|instruct query_yn
f|there's a disused warehouse at the bottom roughly about two a third of the way in from the right|reply_w
g|right right is it eh is it above great lake and below giraffes|acknowledge acknowledge query_yn
f|no it's to the right of great lake on a level with it|reply_n clarify
g|right well in that case i want you to ehm eh curve slightly up to eh just go underneath the giraffes and eh to on a level with the the word giraffes and stop there|acknowledge instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|right now i want you to eh go round the warehouse eh and under the great lake by round i mean over like over the eh the warehouse|instruct instruct
f|okay right|acknowledge acknowledge
g|right and then under the great lake is there any other obstacles there|instruct query_yn
f|no|reply_n
g|and then come up between eh now it's the great lake and eh rock fall halfway between them but over to the left-hand side of the page is the finish point|instruct explain
f|okay|acknowledge
g|right|acknowledge
