g|eh in a slight up gradient 'til you're just sort of past centre of the map|instruct
f|right right right okay|acknowledge acknowledge acknowledge
g|uh-huh ehm better make sure you're a a reasonable bit to the right-hand side of the map actually 'cause there's a a wagon wheel here you've got to miss|acknowledge instruct explain

g|uh-huh|reply_y
f|and then down through the middle of it|check
g|down through the middle of it yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|right so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley|ready align
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|now have you got rocks below that|ready query_yn
f|yeah quite a bit below it uh-huh|reply_y explain acknowledge
g|uh-huh quite a bit below it now you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side|acknowledge ready instruct

f|right right okay|acknowledge acknowledge acknowledge
g|right from there you just want to go eh curves you're underneath the saloon bar|ready instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and from underneath the saloon bar well the finish is ehm i was going to say where where the says finish but of course that's not particularly useful ehm a couple of i'd say five centimetres above the saloon bar and just off a few centimetres off the side of the map on the left-hand side that's where the finish is|instruct explain explain explain
f|oh right ehm i've come down to the left of the saloon bar and i'm like at the bottom of the saloon bar just now|acknowledge explain
g|right you're bottom of the saloon bar|ready check
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|right you just want to curve up eh along past the saloon bar|ready instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|and it's it's about eh it's just a few centimetres out from the left-hand side of the page a few centimetres up from the saloon bar it's|ready instruct
f|oh right no i'm going towards the right just now|acknowledge explain
g|oh you're going towards the right sorry|acknowledge
